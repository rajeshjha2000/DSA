// Time complexity: O(N), Where N is number of nodes of the linked list
// Space complexity: O(1), no extra space used

/*
Problem Statement:
You are given the head of a linked list, which contains a series of integers separated by 0's. 
The beginning and end of the linked list will have Node.val == 0.

For every two consecutive 0's, merge all the nodes lying in between them into a single node 
whose value is the sum of all the merged nodes. The modified list should not contain any 0's.

Return the head of the modified linked list.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Constraints:
1. The number of nodes in the list is in the range [3, 2 * 105].
2. 0 <= Node.val <= 1000
3. There are no two consecutive nodes with Node.val == 0.
4. The beginning and end of the linked list have Node.val == 0.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example 1:
Input: head = [0,3,1,0,4,5,2,0]
Output: [4,11]
Explanation: 
The above figure represents the given linked list. The modified list contains
- The sum of the nodes marked in green: 3 + 1 = 4.
- The sum of the nodes marked in red: 4 + 5 + 2 = 11.

Example 2:
Input: head = [0,1,0,3,0,2,2,0]
Output: [1,3,4]
Explanation: 
The above figure represents the given linked list. The modified list contains
- The sum of the nodes marked in green: 1 = 1.
- The sum of the nodes marked in red: 3 = 3.
- The sum of the nodes marked in yellow: 2 + 2 = 4.
